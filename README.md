# Framed Android App

An Android app that connects to Framed over your local network to show the data Framed collects. This app is useful for those who just want the Framed desktop app running in the background instead of taking up screen space.

## Protocol

This app makes use of a custom protocol, which is documented [in the main Framed repository](https://github.com/Framed-App/framed/blob/main/src/protocol/README.md).
